# CometChat Integration â€“ Tab-Based Messaging UI

This project integrates the **Messaging UI with Tabs, Sidebar, and Message View** using the [CometChat UI Kit](https://www.cometchat.com/docs/ui-kit/flutter/flutter-conversation).

This layout includes different sections for **Chats**, **Calls**, **Users**, and **Groups**, allowing seamless navigation through a tab-based interface.
It provides a structured and intuitive messaging experience with a sidebar and dedicated message view.
